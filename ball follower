    4. INTRODUCTION
Autonomous mobile robots are crucial in sectors like manufacturing, logistics, search-and-rescue, and entertainment. A primary challenge in mobile robotics is enabling a robot to perceive, interpret, and interact with its environment in real time. This project addresses that challenge by developing a ball-tracking and chasing robot designed to autonomously detect, pursue, and maintain a stable distance from a moving object in a simulated environment. By leveraging advanced robotics frameworks and computer vision tools, the project explores principles of perception, sensor integration, and control dynamics in autonomous navigation.
The ball-tracking and chasing task is implemented using the Robot Operating System (ROS2), an open-source framework that supports inter-process communication and modular software design. ROS2’s middleware enables seamless interaction between perception and control nodes, which is crucial for implementing real-time tracking mechanisms. This modularity enhances the system’s efficiency in processing sensor data and allows for adaptable task configurations, ensuring a flexible and scalable system design.
Simulation is central to developing and testing autonomous robots. In this project, Gazebo is employed to replicate real-world physics and environmental constraints, enabling controlled, realistic testing of the robot's interactions. Gazebo’s compatibility with ROS2 supports smooth integration and optimization of control algorithms, which can be refined in a virtual space without hardware constraints. This approach provides an ideal platform for testing the robot’s dynamic responses to changing object positions and movements.
To achieve accurate ball detection and tracking, this project employs OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library known for its extensive image processing functionalities. Using color segmentation, contour detection, and motion estimation techniques, the robot can distinguish the target ball from background clutter, ensuring continuous tracking as the ball moves through the simulated environment. This vision-based tracking capability is crucial to the robot’s task of consistently following the target ball.
In summary, this project integrates ROS2, Gazebo, and OpenCV to develop a functional framework for a ball-tracking and chasing robot, demonstrating foundational techniques in perception, sensor fusion, and autonomous navigation. By exploring the interdependence of these components, the project contributes to the advancement of interactive, vision-based robotic systems applicable to a variety of fields.

    5. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
    • Real-Time Ball Detection: 
Real-time ball detection in robotics involves identifying and tracking a spherical object as it moves, requiring both high-speed processing and robust accuracy. Key elements of real-time ball detection include object recognition, motion tracking, and feature extraction, which must function seamlessly together. A common approach for achieving real-time tracking is through color segmentation and contour detection, where the object is identified by color and shape. By isolating a specific color, such as the ball's unique hue, the system can differentiate it from background clutter. Algorithms then use contour detection to track the object's shape and approximate its position in the environment. Kalman filters and optical flow analysis are also frequently employed to predict the object's motion path, reducing noise and enhancing detection reliability. Real-time detection requires processing speeds fast enough to maintain consistent visual input, making the combination of effective image processing and optimized algorithms essential.

    • OpenCV: 
OpenCV (Open-Source Computer Vision Library) is a widely used library in computer vision, offering a rich collection of tools for image processing and machine vision. Developed to provide a framework for real-time image recognition and manipulation, OpenCV supports functionalities ranging from basic image manipulation to more advanced features like object detection, facial recognition, and motion tracking. For ball tracking, OpenCV provides functions for color thresholding, contour detection, and shape analysis, making it an ideal tool for isolating and following an object with a defined color profile and shape. The library also supports high-speed processing by leveraging hardware acceleration, which is critical in real-time applications. OpenCV’s extensive integration capabilities make it compatible with robotics frameworks like ROS2, allowing vision-based control algorithms to drive autonomous systems and enabling seamless data processing for camera-based input.

    • Gazebo:
Gazebo is a robust simulation environment for robotic applications, providing realistic 3D simulations with physics engines to model real-world interactions. It supports various sensors, environments, and object modelling, allowing users to create and test virtual robot prototypes in real-time. For mobile robots, Gazebo offers built-in models of cameras and sensors, allowing the simulation of real-time visual input, obstacle interactions, and kinematic behavior. Gazebo’s integration with ROS2 allows sensor data from the simulated environment to be processed as though it were gathered from physical hardware, enabling a smooth transition from simulation to real-world testing. This environment is especially useful for developing, testing, and optimizing control algorithms and vision-based tracking systems like those used in ball-chasing robots, ensuring that behavior in simulation closely approximates real-world dynamics.

    • ROS2:
ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) is a flexible, open-source framework that facilitates robot software development by supporting modular, distributed communication between various robotic components. An evolution of ROS, ROS2 provides enhanced support for real-time applications, cross-platform compatibility, and secure, reliable data transfer, which are vital for complex robotic tasks. ROS2’s middleware enables inter-process communication using nodes and topics, a structure that allows developers to build separate modules for perception, control, and sensor processing. In this project, ROS2 enables smooth data flow between the OpenCV-based perception system and the Gazebo simulation, facilitating real-time adjustments to the robot’s movement based on visual input. Its compatibility with Gazebo and OpenCV provides an efficient framework for integrating sensors, vision processing, and control mechanisms, making it ideal for applications that require adaptive, real-time responses in dynamic environments.

    8. METHODOLOGY
    1. Bot Model Creation: The bot model, designed in Fusion 360, includes four wheels and is optimized for movement through disaster struck areas and navigation in areas struck by disaster. The design is converted into URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) to enable simulation in the Gazebo environment.

    2. Ball Tracking using OpenCV: 
    a. Capture Image: Use the camera feed to continuously capture frames of the environment in which the ball is located.


Figure 1:Capture screen

    b. Convert to HSV Color Space: Convert each captured frame from BGR to HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space, making color-based segmentation more robust to lighting variations.


    c. Extract HSV Values of the Ball: Determine the specific HSV range corresponding to the ball’s color through testing or calibration.


Figure 2: Extract HSV Values of Ball

    d. Create a Binary Mask: Apply a threshold using the ball’s HSV range to create a binary mask, where the pixels in the ball’s color range are set to white, and others are set to black.


Figure 3: Binary Mask with Ball Detected
    e. Determine Direction: Compare the ball’s position with the center of the frame:
    • Left: If the ball is to the left of the frame’s center, command the robot to move left.
    • Right: If the ball is to the right, command the robot to move right.
    • Straight: If the ball is near the center, command the robot to move forward.

Figure 4: Final Image with Direction for Bot
    f. Update Loop: Repeat this process for each frame to continuously adjust the robot's direction based on the ball’s location.


Figure 5: Final Simulation of the Whole Process on Loop

    3. Gazebo Simulation Environment: 
    • Develop a simulated environment in Gazebo, modelling the robot and the ball with realistic physics parameters.
    •  Integrate simulated sensors (e.g., camera) into the robot’s design to replicate real-world sensing conditions.
    • Configure Gazebo to be compatible with ROS2, enabling seamless data transmission between the simulation and ROS2 nodes.



Figure 6: Gazebo World









    4. Motion Control Algorithm Development: Designing control algorithms to adjust the robot’s movement in response to the ball’s position. Using a feedback loop to continuously update the robot’s position relative to the ball.
Processing Image Data and Detecting the Ball: This snippet is essential for the detection and localization of the ball. It begins by converting the captured image from BGR to HSV colour space, which enhances colour-based detection. A binary mask is created using the specified HSV range for the ball's colour, allowing the program to isolate the ball from the background. The subsequent contour detection identifies the largest contour, which should correspond to the ball, and computes its position and radius. 




    5. Sensor and System Integration: 

    • Component Integration: The first step is to integrate all individual components of the robot, including the camera, ROS2 nodes for image processing, motion control, and communication. This involves ensuring that all modules are correctly connected, allowing data flow between the image processing node and the motion control node. Each node should subscribe and publish to the appropriate topics in ROS2.

Figure 7: Camera Integration on Bot

    • Testing Data Flow: Once integrated, it’s essential to test the data flow between the components. This can be done using ROS2 tools like rqt_graph to visualize the nodes and their connections. Ensure that the camera node captures images and sends them to the image processing node, which then processes the frames and sends control commands to the motion control node.

    6. Testing:  
We tested the bot by moving the position of the ball in different directions.

    8. METHODOLOGY
    1. Bot Model Creation: The bot model, designed in Fusion 360, includes four wheels and is optimized for movement through disaster struck areas and navigation in areas struck by disaster. The design is converted into URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) to enable simulation in the Gazebo environment.

    2. Ball Tracking using OpenCV: 
    a. Capture Image: Use the camera feed to continuously capture frames of the environment in which the ball is located.


Figure 1:Capture screen

    b. Convert to HSV Color Space: Convert each captured frame from BGR to HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space, making color-based segmentation more robust to lighting variations.


    c. Extract HSV Values of the Ball: Determine the specific HSV range corresponding to the ball’s color through testing or calibration.


Figure 2: Extract HSV Values of Ball

    d. Create a Binary Mask: Apply a threshold using the ball’s HSV range to create a binary mask, where the pixels in the ball’s color range are set to white, and others are set to black.


Figure 3: Binary Mask with Ball Detected
    e. Determine Direction: Compare the ball’s position with the center of the frame:
    • Left: If the ball is to the left of the frame’s center, command the robot to move left.
    • Right: If the ball is to the right, command the robot to move right.
    • Straight: If the ball is near the center, command the robot to move forward.

Figure 4: Final Image with Direction for Bot
    f. Update Loop: Repeat this process for each frame to continuously adjust the robot's direction based on the ball’s location.


Figure 5: Final Simulation of the Whole Process on Loop

    3. Gazebo Simulation Environment: 
    • Develop a simulated environment in Gazebo, modelling the robot and the ball with realistic physics parameters.
    •  Integrate simulated sensors (e.g., camera) into the robot’s design to replicate real-world sensing conditions.
    • Configure Gazebo to be compatible with ROS2, enabling seamless data transmission between the simulation and ROS2 nodes.



Figure 6: Gazebo World









    4. Motion Control Algorithm Development: Designing control algorithms to adjust the robot’s movement in response to the ball’s position. Using a feedback loop to continuously update the robot’s position relative to the ball.
Processing Image Data and Detecting the Ball: This snippet is essential for the detection and localization of the ball. It begins by converting the captured image from BGR to HSV colour space, which enhances colour-based detection. A binary mask is created using the specified HSV range for the ball's colour, allowing the program to isolate the ball from the background. The subsequent contour detection identifies the largest contour, which should correspond to the ball, and computes its position and radius. 




    5. Sensor and System Integration: 

    • Component Integration: The first step is to integrate all individual components of the robot, including the camera, ROS2 nodes for image processing, motion control, and communication. This involves ensuring that all modules are correctly connected, allowing data flow between the image processing node and the motion control node. Each node should subscribe and publish to the appropriate topics in ROS2.

Figure 7: Camera Integration on Bot

    • Testing Data Flow: Once integrated, it’s essential to test the data flow between the components. This can be done using ROS2 tools like rqt_graph to visualize the nodes and their connections. Ensure that the camera node captures images and sends them to the image processing node, which then processes the frames and sends control commands to the motion control node.


Figure 8: RQT Graph
    6. Testing:  
We tested the bot by moving the position of the ball in different directions.
